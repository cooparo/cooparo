# Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my Github profile! 

## About Me

I am a 21-year-old student of **Computer Engineering at the University of Padua** 🎓. I absolutely love learning about new technologies, especially those that are emerging in the fields of privacy, Bitcoin, and Economics.

## What to Expect

Here, you'll find a collection of my projects: everything from personal creations to class assignments. While some projects may be more polished than others, I always work hard to learn and push myself to the best of my abilities in order to produce quality work.
